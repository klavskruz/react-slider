# Klavs Mini Slider
A minimalist, responsive content carousel built using React.js and CSS grid.

Supports mouse swipes, touch swipes and just good old button pushes.

# Coming soon
In future I plan to implement:
smoother animations,
support for multiple slides,
better UI

as the component grows I also would like to implement code splitting.

# Live demo:
A live demo of the carousel can be found at https://pedantic-ramanujan-f135e5.netlify.app/


# Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine & React in your project.


# To Use App:

To use slider component copy the app folder into your project src, import the component and add your desired content to the sliderContent array.

# Reflection
This project is a part of my self-study journey to become an employed developer.
The obstacles I faced during this build included but were not limited to: 
Implementing touch functionality,
finding the alternative to mouse events on mobile devices,
learning to configure webpack and making an application without using create-react-app.

Thanks for taking time to read this and if there is anything you'd like to see me improve contact me!
